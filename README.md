# hsa-ufa-with-gif-methods
üóù A piece of programming history from Holt Software Associates!

*This is my own copy of the library - for the most up to date version of this, check out [this](https://github.com/salamander2/HSA2/).*

### About
From this [useful lesson](http://quarkphysics.ca/ICS3U1/unit4/pdf/1.%20Intro%20to%20HSA2%20Graphics.pdf) on how to use the library:
> This software package was originally written by Holt Software Associates (HSA) to teach Java to students. It was called ‚ÄúReady to Program‚Äù and came with a textbook. The original software was written by Tom West. However ... the software was not upgradeable and it was stuck on Java 2. The company went bankrupt and the sourcecode was not available. At some point it was totally rewritten, reverse engineered, by Sam Scott at Sheridan College who based the graphics on Swing JFrame and JPanels. He called the software HSA_UFA (as it was written for the UFA school). After this Josh Gray from TVDSB added mouse routines. Then Michael Harwood from TVDSB added more drawing commands and other features, renamed it to HSA2, and made a GitHub repository for the project at https://github.com/salamander2/HSA2.

### Context
I used this library in my own Gr. 11 Computer Science class - ICS3U (and even added some methods of my own to be able to show gifs). This repository is here for posterity.
